Objects are runtime instances of static structures (object type)
	Example: Process, mutex, event, desktop, file, thread

Reside In system memory space

Kernel code can obtain direct pointer to an object

User mode code can only obtain a handle to an object
	Shields user code from directly accessing an object

Objects are reference counted

The object manager is the entity responsible for creating, obtaining and otherwise manipulating objects
