A class in C++ is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates both data (variables) and behaviour (functions or methods) in a single entity. Objects created from a class can contain attributes (the data) and operate on that data using methods defined within the class.

In C++, classes are one of the key elements for implementing object-oriented programming (OOP), and allow real-world concepts to be represented in a program in a more intuitive and structured way.

Key characteristics of a class:
Encapsulation: It groups data and functions that operate on that data into a single unit. In addition, it can control access to data through access specifiers such as private, public, and protected.

Abstraction: Hides the internal details of the implementation and exposes only what is necessary through a public interface (public functions).

Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit features from another class, promoting code reuse and the creation of class hierarchies.

Polymorphism: Ability to use a common interface for different types of objects, allowing different classes to respond differently to the same function call.
