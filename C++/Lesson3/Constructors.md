In C++, a constructor is a special function used to initialise objects of a class. It is called automatically when an instance of the class is created. The main purpose of a constructor is to initialise the members of the class with default values or with values provided by the user when creating the object.

Some important characteristics of constructors in C++ are:

Same name as the class: The constructor has the same name as the class in which it is defined.

No return type: Unlike other functions, constructors do not have a return type, not even void.

Automatic: It is called automatically when an object of the class is created.

Can be overloaded: Several constructors can be defined in the same class, as long as they have different parameter lists (overloading).
