In C++, a method is a function that is defined within a class or structure and operates on the member data of that class or structure. Methods allow objects of the class to interact with their own attributes and are generally the primary mechanism for implementing the behaviour of objects.

Methods can perform a variety of tasks, such as modifying object attributes, accessing object attributes, executing specific operations or behaviours, and providing an interface for interacting with the data encapsulated in the object.
