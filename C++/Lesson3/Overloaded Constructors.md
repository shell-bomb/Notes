An overloaded constructor in C++ is when a class has more than one constructor with different parameter lists, allowing objects of that class to be created in different ways. Overloaded constructors must be differentiated by the number or type of arguments they accept, as they cannot be differentiated solely by the value of their parameters.

Constructor overloading allows an object of a class to be initialised in different ways, depending on the arguments passed to the constructor at the time of object creation.
